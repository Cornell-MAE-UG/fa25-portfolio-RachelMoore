Between the years 2018 & 2019, Boeing's 737 MAX passenger airliner crashed twice, resulting in hundreds of casualties. These crashes were caused by repeated malfunction of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The MAE 4300 Engineers and Society course prompted students to analyze the underlying causes and effects of this incident, encouraging a multifaceted perspective on the event. 

The MCAS was designed to automatically correct the aircraft's pitch in order to prevent stall under certain flight conditions. Triggering the system solely relied on the input of the angle-of-attack sensor, but incorrect sensor data caused MCAS to repeatedly force the planes to nose dive. The situation was increased in severity when paired with a lack of pilot training on the system and organizational pressures related to certification speed, cost, and competition with Airbus. A series of 4 activities were held in class that promoted analysis of the ethicality of Boeing decisions in repsonse to these events. The first activity consisted of formulating ethical questions with the intent of later answering them through research. The questions were intended to be ambiguous, with complex answers and solutions. For example, a question I posed was "How should Boeing as a company have defined accountability in order to enact permanent change post-incident?" 

A following activity staged research of the FAA, PBS, and Frontline reports, having us compile facts that add understanding towards situations relating to our questions. These facts pertained to material, individual, and organizational areas. This activity also encouraged taking terms like transparency, or trust, and identifying how Boeing would define these terms before and after the crashes. A sequential activity involved deeper research into the ASME Canons and how numerous parties in Boeing should have followed each of these canons. After identifying the parties involved in our questions, we analyzed their individual stakes and influence in the situation. For example, primary stake-holders are Boeing lawyers and managers who can make high-level change, and secondary stake-holders are families and news outlets effected by the crashes. We were prompted to study how pre-crash decisions made by Boeing officials conflicted with each of the ASME Canons, then think of a solution to their actions that aligns with the canons. 

A concluding activity was to formulate idealistic solutions to our original questions and challenge them by pointing out difficulties with carrying out the solution. This involved simultaneous analysis of the economic, organizational, and individual limits on Boeing officials that prevent them from simply following our advice. Identification of changes that need to be made first in order for the solutions to take place was identified. 

These activities strengthened understanding by shifting analysis away from a purely technical explanation and toward a systems-level perspective. The worksheets demonstrated how engineering failures are often embedded within broader institutional contexts, where time pressure, cost constraints, regulatory capture, and organizational culture can influence design and safety decisions. By explicitly connecting technical design choices to ethical responsibility and societal impact, the activities reinforced the idea that engineers are accountable not only for performance but also for the downstream consequences of their work on public safety and trust.
